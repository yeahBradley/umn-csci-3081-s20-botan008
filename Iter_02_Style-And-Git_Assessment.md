### Iteration 2 - Style-And-Git Partial Assessment (Graded By: Pallavi Mitra)

Run on April 19, 16:16:47 PM.

<hr>

This Partial Assessment indicates a TA has begun grading your Iteration 2 Design. However, design will be graded using a Canvas rubric and grades will only be posted on Canvas once every student's program design has been graded. We ask for your patience at this time.

		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-04-09 Merge branch 'Iter2/06-bus-depot' into devel #13 

		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-04-09 feat(Bus Depot w/strategy pattern): #13 Implementation of a bus depot utilizing a strategy pattern is complete. Each strategy is its own class that is derived from an abstract class. bus_deployment.h/.cc and the StrategyBusFactory is where this implementation exists.


		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-04-09 Merge branch 'Iter2/05-bus-observer-pattern' into devel #12 Programming for the branch is complete. Merging back to devel.


		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-04-09 (origin/Iter2/05-bus-observer-pattern, Iter2/05-bus-observer-pattern) feat(Observer Pattern(lab14)): #12 Programming for the Observer Pattern for busses is complete. This required pulling provided code from Lab 14 files and making changes to visualization simulator and the bus class.


		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-04-09 Merge branch 'support-code' into Iter2/05-bus-observer-pattern #12 I am getting the updates to Lab14 and merging them with the branch for the
observer pattern.

		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-04-09 (origin/Iter2/04-fix-unit-tests, Iter2/04-fix-unit-tests) fix(unit tests): #11 Unit tests were not compiling The bug was caused by the name change of the method NextStop to ToNextStop in the Route class. It has been corrected and the Unit Tests run.


		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-04-09 Merge branch 'Iter2/03-regression-files-cpplint' into devel #10 

		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-04-09 (origin/Iter2/03-regression-files-cpplint, Iter2/03-regression-files-cpplint) style(r_* files or the regression test files): #10 Made regression files google style compliant Upon running cpplint on issue #9 I learned that the regression files failed dozens of times. I would not stand for that. So I endeavored to correct them.


		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-04-09 Merge branch 'Iter2/02-fix-bus-types-factories' into devel #9 

		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-04-09 (origin/Iter2/02-fix-bus-types-factories, Iter2/02-fix-bus-types-factories) refactor(bus types and bus factories): #9 Condense no. of files for bus types and factories. Instead of having 14 files for the bus types and bus factories, there are now only 4 files. src is now easier to navigate.


		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-04-08 Merge branch 'support-code' into devel Aquiring all the new lab materials.

		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-04-01 (tag: Iter2D1) Merge branch 'Iter2/01-lab13-regression' into devel #8 Lab13 and Iteration 2 Deliverable 1 is complete.


		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-04-01 (origin/Iter2/01-lab13-regression, Iter2/01-lab13-regression) feat(/drivers, /src): #8 Regression tests for core design of passenger, stop, bus, route. First, I reorganized/renamed the lab13 files to my liking. Now, they appear next to each other within the src folder as drivers/r_regression_driver.cc, src/r_simulator.h, src/r_local_simulator.h/.cc, and src/r_passenger_generator.h/.cc.

Next, I implemented the second regression test described in lab13. Upon each passenger generation phase, the number of passengers generated is equal to the stop.id_ + 1. This is a lot of passengers and makes the file size for the output very large (10x the provided test). The files for this test are drivers/r_my_regression_test.cc, src/r_my_local_simulator.h/.cc, and src/r_my_passenger_generator.h/.cc.






		[Bradley Botanel] 2020-03-29 feat(Lab13: regression test): #8 Add files from lab13 Adding lab13 files to my repo and reseting vole.
